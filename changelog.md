- **Additions**
  - Added declaration substitution, which outputs the contents of a CSS block declaration, using the format `$<selector>`.
  - Added object notation, used by placing square brackets after a set of attribute-value pairs (which is the same as a CSS block) surrounded by curly brackets: `{attr1: val1; attr2: val2;}[attr1]`.

## 0.6.0
*2020-07-26*
- **New features**
  - Added command-line support using `node novasheets <args>` (or, after installing using `npm install -g novasheets`: `novasheets <args>`).
    - Arguments: `[--compile] <input file> <output file>` to compile a NovaSheets file into CSS; `--parse` to parse raw NovaSheets   content and log the output CSS to the console; `--help` to display help; and `--version` to display the current version.
  - Added previous element selectors, used to copy the contents of the previous CSS selector.

    - Add less-than signs (`<`) to slice the last item off the selector (for example, if `&<` becomes `div+pre<`, the output is `div`); characters treated as delimiters are `>`, `+`, `~`, and whitespace.

  - Added built-in function `@tone` which blends a color with gray. Syntax: `$(@tone | <color> | [<amount>] )`.
  - Added built-in function `@contrast` which controls a value dependent on the contrast of a color. Syntax: `$(@contrast | <color> | <light> | <dark> )`.
  - Added built-in function `@grayscale` (alias `@greyscale`) which removes the hue of a color. Syntax: `$(@grayscale| <color> )`.
- **Changes**
